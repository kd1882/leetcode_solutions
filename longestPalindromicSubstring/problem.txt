Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic
 
substring
 in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.


This code defines a function that finds the longest palindrome in a given string 's'. A palindrome is a string that can be read from left to right and vice versa. 
The function first checks if the length of the given string 's' is less than 2, and if it is so, it directly returns the string itself because a single character string is a palindrome. 


Then, the function initializes an empty string variable called 'res'. It then defines a nested function called 'expandPalindrome(left: int, right: int) -> str', which 
takes two arguments- left and right, representing the leftmost and rightmost position of the current palindrome. This function checks if the current palindrome is valid 
by comparing the characters at the left and right positions, moving both positions towards the center one character at a time until an invalid character or the edge of the 
string is reached. If the current palindrome is valid, the current left and right positions are returned as a palindrome string.


The function then iterates over every position in the given string and calls the 'expandPalindrome' function twice for each position- first assuming that the longest palindrome might be 
odd in length, and second, assuming that it might be even. The longest palindrome string found so far is stored in the 'res' variable, which is updated if a longer palindrome is found.


Finally, the function returns the longest palindrome string found over all the iterations.
